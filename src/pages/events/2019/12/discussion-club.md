      Each participant can present anything of their recent experience or some interesting aspects of their work with Sitecore. We tend to limit these talks to 5 minutes, having up to 10 talks during the event. It serves as sort of warmup! Call for speakers opens 48 hours before the event via the Discussion Club website, where new participants have priority.

    who: Everyone!

      This is the most important part of the event. Each participant may suggest a problem they currently have for a collective-mindset to challenge, but it's not limited to day-to-day issues. One might like to discuss new Sitecore features or whatsoever if it is interesting to other members to discuss (e.g. "can someone please tell in which cases SXA is perfect for greenfield projects and how do I 'sell' it to my client?"). All suggestions are registered at the website, and at the beginning when the organizer goes along this list - each one briefly explains the problem. Each participant votes for topics that seem to be interesting, and then the discussion starts!
